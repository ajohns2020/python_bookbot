# python_bookbot

This bookbot displays whatever text and within the path books/<filename>. DEFAULT FILEPATH: books/frankenstien.txt 

NOTE: The original path for frankenstein.txt in books will not download through git clone (to save space). The directory books is located within the .gitignore file. You will have to download a copy of Frankenstien to use:  https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/41445/pg41445.txt OR you can add your own text by changing the file path in main from books/frankenstien. 

ANOTHER NOTE: You need to make a books directory after downloading. 

Cloning: git clone https://github.com/ajohns2020/python_bookbot
